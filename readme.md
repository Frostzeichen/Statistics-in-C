# About Statistics in C

**Statistics in C** is a module for doing statistics work in C. It is designed to be used in low-level and edge-computed applications, written in a way that makes it easy for a user to edit when needed.

## For the user
The only thing you'll really need here is the file named `statistics_in_c.h`.

The file `main.c` is a demo so you can see how it works and so I can easily try out things for testing and stuff for myself.

Also, let me know at cruztjomar@gmail.com if there is any kind of statistical test you'd want to see added here. For now though, I'm only planning to go through my checklist first.

## Demo
Access the demo to see a taste of Statistics in C by going to my Replit repository:

https://replit.com/@Terenz-JomarJom/Statistics-in-C

Or if you want to compile this by yourself, all you need are these two files:

- main.c
- statistics_in_c.h

The rest are just Replit mumbo-jumbo to make things work over there.
